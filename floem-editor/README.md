# Floem Editor

The core editor part of Lapce as a general text editor view.

The primary aim is to allow the editor to be used in other projects, with enough room for extensibility that it can be used in Lapce itself.  
  
There are a variety of features that are in Lapce but do not belong in the core editor. Ex: syntax highlighting, language server integration, the specific way Lapce saves, how Lapce handles keybindings, etc.  
Other features are more ambiguous as to whether they should be within this repo or not. Ex: editor splits, find/replace, etc.
